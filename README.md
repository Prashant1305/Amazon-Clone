## About
We are a team of skilled web developers specializing in the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. Our project is an Amazon clone, an e-commerce website designed to efficiently manage user data, product information, and shopping cart functionality. Notable features include seamless session persistence, allowing users to resume their activities even after reloading the page.

## Key Achievements
Admin Rights Integration: Implemented a dynamic navigation bar that reveals additional options when users gain admin privileges.
Robust Security Measures: Ensured high security by storing user data in the form of JWT (JSON Web Tokens) keys within local storage.
Middleware Authentication: Every user action is meticulously authenticated through various middleware layers.
Data Transformation: Collected product data from Kaggle, meticulously cleaned it, and adapted it to fit our schema requirements.
Skills
Our commitment to creating user-friendly and scalable web applications, coupled with our technical proficiency in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and React.js, positions us as valuable assets to any development team.
